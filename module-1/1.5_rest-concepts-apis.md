### REST Concepts and Web APIs

#### What is an API?

> Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place. [from Mozilla's Introduction to web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction) from Mozilla. 


#### A web API
Takes data from a service (e.g. a database) and returns it in a machine readable format to the client, for front-end processing.

Smashing Magazine has posted an extremely comprehensive discussion about REST APIs available [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/). Make sure you read it.

#### Key terms

**GET**  
Requests data from the specified resource

**POST**  
Sends data to the specified resource

**DELETE**  
Removes 

**PUT**  
Updates data at the specified resource

**Protocol**  
The common prototcol used in a web-based API is: http or https

**API resuest**
The url used to request data: `https://api.spotify.com/v1/browse/categories`

**Query Parameter**
The final part of an endpoint - what comes after a question mark: `http://api.cupcakes.com/search?flavour=chocolate&topping=sprinkles`


**JSON**
JavaScript Object Notation. The common format in which data is sent and received from a Web API. A JSON object looks like:

```
"total_works": 139,
    "name": "PRESTON, Margaret",
    "sex": "Female",
    "birth_date": 1875,
    "works": [
        {
            "mediacat": [
                {
                    "mediacat": "Album",
                    "id": 10
                }
            ],
            "title": "Recipe book.",
            "url": "/dvapi/work/6446/",
            "image": null,
            "role": "artist",
            "artists": [
                {
                    "url": "/dvapi/artist/12700/timeline/",
                    "role": "artist",
                    "id": 12700,
                    "name": "PRESTON, Margaret"
                }
            ],
            "print_type": [],
            "work_date": 1915
        },
