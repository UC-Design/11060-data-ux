### REST Concepts



Things to do

Follow along with the REST API Concepts examples - try entering your home address in the Google maps geocoding API, and look at the results. Then enter your Lat / Long in the Instagram search API via the Apigee console (note that you need to authorise the console to use your Instagram account).

You can add spaces to the address using “+” eg http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=22+Smith+st+Weetangera&sensor=false (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

Install a browser extension like JSONView ()Links to an external site. to help format and navigate JSON in the browser

Muck around with https://apigee.com/console/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. - some APIs require authentication, but others don’t!


If you would still like to test then I've made a 'sandbox' page which you can download here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. Note that you need to have an Instagram account and you need to generate an access token to use in the file - instructions are there. You should then check out the data being logged in the browser console. You can change the API call to return what you want, just follow the Instagram API endpoint info here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..
