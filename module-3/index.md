## Designing for Data Informed User Experience 
### Module 3: Interactive Project

In this group project you will produce a novel interactive work that responds to an identified design problem.

## Task

The project requires you to define a design problem and create a functional solution using dynamic data retrieved from APIs. You will work in small groups (2-3 people) and utilise the SCRUM methodology to track your contribution to the project. The Interactive project is broken into 3 components:

1.  Project proposal: all students will develop a project proposal to be presented in-class in week 9. It will include a: tentative project title, a design problem, initial ideas about how to resolve this problem, consideration of context, basic sketches/wireframes, items for initial product backlog.

2.  The interactive project: this will be a significant piece of work and will be presented online as a responsive, standards compliant, interactive interface.

3.  Production journal: an individual journal documenting the design and development process and your individual contributions to the project.

## Defining the problem

> A problem isn’t simply an unwanted situation or a matter that deviates from the norm—although these are still valid definitions of a problem. For designers and creative problem solving, a problem is an unmet need that, if met, can satisfy the user’s purpose. ([source](https://www.toptal.com/designers/product-design/design-problem-statement))

Being able to define a problem, and then resolve it, is an important part of any designer or developers skillset. Solving a problem is what moves design beyond a purely creative undertaking. 

In industry, a client will present you with a problem (e.g. I have this new housing development and I need to sell a lot of the units so that I can make a profit), which you then need to solve. In this example, it mkght be through the creation of branding, marketing collateral and interactive works - the quality of the final outcome might depend on the price point of the product. 

Identifying a design problem is a tricky task, but, defining a design problem is a core component of the design thinking process. 

Read this article which provides some good background information: [Stage 2 in the Design Thinking Process: Define the Problem and Interpret the Results](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-2-in-the-design-thinking-process-define-the-problem-and-interpret-the-results)

## But that's so broad...

Yes, yes it is.

In this project, I really want you to think carefully about the world around you - what kind of issues do you notice,  what could be improved through design.

The problem needs to be something that you can resolve using an API (or ideally, multiple APIs). So, for example, if the problem was:

>   I'd like to know what kind aof animals and plants are common in the area near my house.

or even, 

>   I'd like to know what kind of insects/spiders/bugs live in the error where I've just rented this cool Airbnb place for my long weekend. 

Then you could start by looking at how you could use [OpenCage Geocoder](http://opencagedata.com) (to get the address) and then perhaps the [Atlas of Living Australia API](http://api.ala.org.au) to return the fauna/flora info.

There is a fantastic list of [public APIs available here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis).

Please email me with any initial ideas and we can work on expanding them.
