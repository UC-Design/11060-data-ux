# Designing for Data Informed User Experience 
## Module 2: APIs in practice

### API to HTML




This video (on Canvas) takes you from API data to simple HTML, using jQuery to load data and build HTML dynamically.

#### Before You Start
To follow along with this video you will need:
<ul>
<li>An API key for the DarkSky API - you can register <a href="https://darksky.net/dev/register">here</a></li>
<li>A text editor</li>
<li>A JSON viewer plugin for your browser - here's one for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en">Chrome</a> and one for <a href="https://github.com/rfletcher/safari-json-formatter/downloads">Safari</a></li>
<li><a href="https://code.jquery.com/">jQuery CDN</a></li>
<li>A browser for testing, e.g. Safari, Chrome etc. See info below about CORS errors...
<ul>
<li>If you use Chrome you may encounter a CORS error (e.g.&nbsp;<span>No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin</span>), to resolve this you need to download a plugin like this <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en-US">one</a>. You shouldn't have any issues in Safari.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

#### CORS
When testing your local web applications you may run into a CORS error. Mozilla provides a good introduction:
"(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS] is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one origin (domain) have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin.A web application makes a <strong>cross-origin HTTP request</strong> when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, and port) than its own origin." Read the whole article (here)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS].

Additionally, there is a great blog post (with code examples) available (here)[https://jvaneyck.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/cross-domain-requests-in-javascript/], that I would strongly recommend reading.

If you are using Chrome you will need to install a plugin like (this one)[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en-US] which will allow you to run your code locally without encountering a CORS error. If you use Safari you *should* be fine... but if not, you can alter your code to request JSONP instead of pure JSON. &nbsp;

You can also try requesting JSONP (json with padding - see article above which explains what it is). To do this you need to make two changes to your code:

Add an empty callback (&amp;callback=?) to the API call, so it looks like:
```var url = 'https://api.darksky.net/forecast/' + key + '/' + cbr + '?units=auto<strong>&amp;callback=?</strong>';```

Change the
```$.get(url, function(data) {});```

to

```$.getJSON(url, function(data) {});```
